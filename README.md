# lyric-completion-game

Cameron said BU were going to have an open house on Sunday.
Th√©o had mentionned something about Emmett and a stand.
Emmett mentionned something about making pamphlets.
I'm assuming it's a music club stand.
If I were in charge of a music club stand I'd make people guess song lyrics and give em sweet treats as prizes.
So I made this.

When you scan the QR code the page will load on a welcome note.
Then you can enter your name.
Then you can choose the music-related game you want to play.
Then you are congratulated/consoled, and asked to positively consider giving the music club a chance because they would be glad to have you.

The games proposed so far are: complete the incomplete lyric, guess the original lyric.
